/**
 * GENERATION IS THE ONLY PLACE THIS SERVER SPENDS MONEY.
 *
 * flow.google.com (September 2026 onward) runs the composer in DIRECT mode:
 * the prompt goes straight to the selected model and is charged on send. There
 * is no proposal card to reject. The price is instead stated up front in the
 * composer's settings popover ("Generating will use N credits"), so the gate is:
 *
 *   configure -> attach frames -> type prompt -> READ THE QUOTE -> check it
 *   -> only then press send
 *
 * Every refusal happens before send, while it is still free:
 *   - no readable quote            -> refuse
 *   - a "free" still quoting > 0   -> refuse
 *   - quote > expected_max_cost    -> refuse
 *   - quote would break the budget -> refuse
 * and an in-flight generation is never resubmitted: completion is detected by
 * diffing the media library, never by touching the composer again.
